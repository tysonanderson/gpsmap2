      <h3>KIANNA JACKSON, 20</h3>

      <p><strong>Background:</strong> When she disappeared on Oct. 6, 2013, Kianna Jackson was staying at a cheap motel in Costa Mesa and working as a prostitute along Harbor Boulevard. She had previously lived in Las Vegas.</p>

      <p><strong>Family:</strong> Jackson often talked on the phone with her mother, Kathy Menzies of Mendocino County, and posted to social media such as Instagram and Facebook. After Oct. 6, Menzies said, the calls and posts suddenly ceased. "She just dropped off."</p>

      <p><strong>Last heard from:</strong> According to court records, Jackson sent a text message at 3:09 p.m. Oct. 6, 2013, from a location near Harbor Boulevard and McFadden Avenue, a well-known prostitution hub, and received a text at 4:05 p.m. while in an industrial area of Anaheim.</p>

      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Jackson remains missing. Authorities believe she was kidnapped, raped and murdered, and left in a dumpster at an auto body shop where one of her killers worked. Her body is believed to be buried at a landfill in Sylmar or Brea.</p>

      <h3>JARRAE ESTEPP, 21</h3>

      <p><strong>Background:</strong> Jarrae Estepp arrived in Orange County on March 13, 2014, on a Greyhound bus from Oklahoma. Authorities believe she came to work as prostitute near Beach Boulevard and West Ball Road in Anaheim, a prostitution hub.</p>

      <p><strong>Family:</strong> Estepp is the mother of a 3-year-old boy. Jodi Pier-Estepp said her daughter tried leaving prostitution and working as an exotic dancer. “That’s where her passion lay, and that’s what she enjoyed,” Estepp said. “I was perfectly fine with the exotic dancing and watched her dance. She loved the attention. She was very good at it … and I was proud of her.”</p>

      <p><strong>Last heard from:</strong> Estepp received a phone call while she was near Beach Boulevard and West Ball Road at 7:08 p.m. on March 13, 2014, and her phone died minutes later, while she was near Brookhurst and the 91 freeway, court records show. The next morning her body was found on a conveyer belt at an Anaheim recycling facility, sparking a homicide investigation.</p>

      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Estepp’s body has been cremated. Her family plans to bury the ashes in February 2015 at her father’s gravesite in Oklahoma. Authorities believe she was kidnapped, raped and murdered, and left in a dumpster at an auto body shop where one of her killers worked.</p>

      <p><strong>Family:</strong> Anaya’s mother, Herlinda Salcido, said she usually spoke with her daughter several times a day and always said "good night" around bedtime. On Nov. 12, 2013, a few weeks before Anaya planned a birthday celebration, she disappeared.</p>
